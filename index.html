  <h2>About The Interactive Parallel Sessions</h2>

<h3>LEGO® SERIOUS PLAY ® (LSP)</h3>
<small>Morning and Afternoon Sessions. 20 places available</small>
<p>
Lego serious Play LEGO® SERIOUS PLAY ® (LSP) is an innovative, experiential process which has been shown to extend players’ awareness of problems and ideas, and to enhance creativity and enable teamwork. LSP is a facilitated workshop where participants build models using LEGO bricks. These models are then used as symbolic and metaphorical statements which provide a basis for discussion. In this instance, the workshop models created will respond to the theme ‘Innovation at Play’.
</p>
<p>
Workshop participants will first build individual models and present these to the other members in their team. The most important elements in the models are then extracted and used to form a new model, representative of the group. This iterative process continues until team consensus is reached.
</p><p>
The LSP method is based on mutual respect, enabling everyone to express their ideas in a non-judgmental, creative and playful way.</p>
<p>
Using the hand-mind connection as a path for creative and expressive thinking, this workshop will emphasise the importance of play as a way to learn through exploration and storytelling.
</p>

<h3>Soft Robotics Toolkit</h3>
<small>Full day session. 20 places available</small>
<p>
The Soft Robotics Toolkit is a collection of shared resources to support the design, fabrication, modeling, characterization, and control of soft robotic devices. The toolkit was developed as part of educational research being undertaken in the Harvard Biodesign Lab. The ultimate aim of the toolkit is to advance the field of soft robotics by allowing designers and researchers to build upon each other’s work. The toolkit includes an open source fluidic control board, detailed design documentation describing a wide range of soft robotic components (including actuators and sensors), and related files that can be downloaded and used in the design, manufacture, and operation of soft robots. In combination with low material costs and increasingly accessible rapid prototyping technologies such as 3D printers, laser cutters, and CNC mills, the toolkit enables soft robotic components to be produced easily and affordably.</p>

<h3>Mask Making</h3>
<small>Morning and Afternoon Sessions. 20 places available</small>
<p>
This workshop offers a facilitated experience using Maskmaking as a tool for reflection on the process of the person as inventor and innovator of self. The workshop uses creativity to explore and critically discuss the challenges and leaning issues that arise in the life/work environment. Participants will have the opportunity to make a mask, be involved in understanding the process of this therapeutic creative approach and discuss the output.
  </p>

  <h3>Drama Workshop: Innovation through Play</h3>
  <small>Morning and Afternoon Sessions. 20 places available</small>
  <p>This workshop will focus on integrating drama techniques and innovation methodologies to give participants new perspectives of the use of drama to promote innovation.</p>
